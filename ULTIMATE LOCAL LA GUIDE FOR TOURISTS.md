LA is a very wide long city, think of it as 20-30 cities inside of one huge county. You can only walk within cities not across cities. Which leaves the option of driving, LA is built for cars.Â  Car rental recommended but uber can work.

Places to Avoid, not because itâ€™s bad or itâ€™s dangerous but just because itâ€™s not a very nice environment.
- Outskirts of Downtown LAÂ 
- Generally South of the 10 freeway
- North San Fernando valley
- Venice Beach (Nice, but a little dirty, usually smells like weed)
